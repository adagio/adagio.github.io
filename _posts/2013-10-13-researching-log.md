## Log about researching I've done this week

+ [Migrando un Field Formatter a Drupal 8](https://speakerdeck.com/paracuerdas/migrando-un-field-formatter-a-drupal-8) (Upgrading a Field Formatter to Drupal 8)
A Keynote in Spanish, about how to port to Drupal 8 a module that creates a Field Formatter.

+ In the road to Drupal 8, we are currently on drupal-8.0-alpha3. When doing this Keynote, I found that there are coming some changes that affect Field Formatters.
    + [File formatters need to manually check the 'display' property of each item](https://drupal.org/node/2047939)
    + [#type 'markup'removed](https://drupal.org/node/2036237)
    + [Removed text_sanitize() and save_value/safe_summary in favor of processed/summary_processed](https://drupal.org/node/2090719)
    + [Annotation based plugins don't need a use statement anymore](https://drupal.org/node/2096117)
    [All reported changes can be found in Changes records](https://drupal.org/list-changes/drupal)

+ [DrupalCamp Per√∫ 2013](http://lima2013.drupalperu.org/)
